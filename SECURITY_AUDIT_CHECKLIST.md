# üîí Security Audit & Checklist

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Git Security Scan
- **ggshield**: ‚úÖ Configured and running on pre-commit hook
- **Status**: "No secrets have been found" - All clear
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit` contains ggshield secret scan

## üö® CRITICAL - Database Security (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

### Row Level Security (RLS) Violations
**Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL - Multiple tables exposed without authentication

**Affected Tables** (from Supabase Security Advisor):
- `workout_types` - Public access without RLS
- `workout_phases` - Public access without RLS  
- `instructors_narratives` - Public access without RLS
- `trainers` - Public access without RLS
- `trainer_specialties` - Public access without RLS
- `trainer_specialized_tags` - Public access without RLS
- `trainer_activities_parent_support` - Public access without RLS
- `users` - Public access without RLS ‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREMELY CRITICAL
- `user_workout_plans` - Public access without RLS ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- `user_weekly_schedule` - Public access without RLS ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- `track_phase_mappings` - Public access without RLS
- `spotify_tracks` - Public access without RLS
- `community_posts` - Public access without RLS
- `community_post_likes` - Public access without RLS
- `user_follows` - Public access without RLS
- `shared_playlists` - Public access without RLS
- `spotify_analysis_logs` - Public access without RLS ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - Contains user workout data

### IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:
```bash
# Run this SQL file on your production database IMMEDIATELY:
psql -d your_production_database < database-updates/fix-rls-security-violations.sql
```

## ‚úÖ API Keys & Environment Variables

### Properly Secured:
- **Spotify Client ID**: ‚úÖ Public client ID (safe to expose)
- **RapidAPI Key**: ‚úÖ In `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- **Supabase Keys**: ‚úÖ Anon key is public-safe, service key should be server-only

### Environment File Status:
- **`.env.local`**: ‚úÖ In `.gitignore` (not tracked)
- **Production deployment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify environment variables are set in deployment platform

## üîê Security Best Practices Implemented

### ‚úÖ Client-Side Security:
- Environment variables properly prefixed with `VITE_` for client exposure control
- API keys stored in environment files, not hardcoded
- Git pre-commit hooks scanning for secrets
- No sensitive data in client-side code

### ‚úÖ API Integration Security:
- RapidAPI requests use proper headers and authentication
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse (3 requests/day max)
- Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- Caching prevents unnecessary API calls

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Immediate Actions (HIGH PRIORITY):
- [ ] **Apply RLS fixes** - Run the SQL migration immediately
- [ ] **Verify production environment variables** - Check deployment platform
- [ ] **Test authentication flows** after RLS is enabled
- [ ] **Audit user sessions** - Ensure spotify_analysis_logs are properly scoped

### 2. Medium Priority:
- [ ] **Implement proper session management** for spotify_analysis_logs
- [ ] **Add content security policy (CSP)** headers
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS everywhere** in production
- [ ] **Set up database connection encryption**

### 3. Long-term Improvements:
- [ ] **Implement API rate limiting** at application level
- [ ] **Add request logging and monitoring** 
- [ ] **Set up automated security scanning** in CI/CD
- [ ] **Regular security audits** of dependencies

## üö® CURRENT RISK ASSESSMENT

### CRITICAL RISKS (Fix Immediately):
1. **User data exposure** - All user tables accessible without authentication
2. **Workout data exposure** - Analysis logs visible to anyone
3. **Community data exposure** - User posts and follows publicly accessible

### MODERATE RISKS:
1. **API key management** - Currently secure but needs production verification
2. **Session management** - Need to implement proper user session tracking

### LOW RISKS:
1. **Client-side code** - Properly secured with environment variables
2. **Git repository** - Protected by ggshield secret scanning

## üìä Compliance & Privacy

### GDPR/Privacy Considerations:
- **User data**: Currently exposed (CRITICAL - fix with RLS)
- **Workout analytics**: Currently exposed (CRITICAL - fix with RLS)  
- **Music preferences**: Currently exposed (CRITICAL - fix with RLS)

### Data Protection After RLS Fix:
- Users can only access their own data
- Workout analytics properly scoped to user sessions
- Community features have appropriate privacy controls
- Public data (workout types, trainers) remains accessible

## üîß Verification Steps

After applying the RLS fix:

1. **Test user authentication**:
   ```sql
   -- This should only return the authenticated user's data
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth.uid() = id;
   ```

2. **Verify data isolation**:
   ```sql
   -- This should return empty for other users' data
   SELECT * FROM spotify_analysis_logs WHERE session_id = 'other_users_session';
   ```

3. **Check public data access**:
   ```sql
   -- This should work without authentication
   SELECT * FROM workout_types;
   ```

## üìû Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:
1. **Immediately apply RLS fixes**
2. **Review Supabase audit logs** for unusual access
3. **Rotate API keys** if necessary
4. **Notify users** if personal data was exposed
5. **Update security policies** based on findings

---

**NEXT STEPS**: Run the RLS security fix immediately, then verify all tests pass with the new security policies.
